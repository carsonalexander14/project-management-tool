# Social Team Builder (Project Management Tool)

This project is the final Unit 12 project for the Python Web Development Team Treehouse Techdegree.

## Description

Users can sign up to find projects that need help or post their own projects for other people to join. Users create a brief profile for themselves after they sign up with an avatar, a bio, and pick their skills from a list. Users projects, too, giving it a title, description, and other details. They also list the positions they need filled for that job with a brief description of what the position will be responsible for. Users are able to find a project and ask to join it. If you're a project owner, you can approve or deny the person asking to join. Finally, users are able to login and logout of their account.
